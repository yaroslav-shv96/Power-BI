# Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence (2023) Course on Udemy

## AdventureWorks report
:paperclip: **The Situation**
You’ve just been hired as a Business Intelligence Analyst by AdventureWorks*, a global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories

:paperclip: **The Brief**
The management team needs a way to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers. All you’ve been given is a folder of raw csv files, which contain information about transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories.

:paperclip: **The Objective**
**Use Power BI to:**
+ connecting and shaping the source data
+ building a relational model
+ adding calculated columns and measures
+ designing an interactive report

## MavenMarket report
This time I worked with data from Maven Market, a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Just like the AdventureWorks project, I went through the entire business intelligence workflow: connected and shaped the data, built a relational model, added calculated fields, and designed an interactive report.
