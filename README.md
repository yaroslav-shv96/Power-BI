The Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence course on Udemy was incredibly beneficial for me. It provided comprehensive coverage of Power BI usage, with hands-on tutorials that facilitated learning. The Maven Markets project, in particular, offered practical experience in dashboard creation from scratch, which was invaluable.

The project centered around data from Maven Market, a multinational grocery chain with branches in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. 
Tasks Performed through the entire business intelligence workflow: :-
+connecting and shaping the source data,
+building a relational model,
+adding calculated columns and measures,
+designing an interactive report.
